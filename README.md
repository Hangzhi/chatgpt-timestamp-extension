# ChatGPT Timestamp Extension

A simple Chrome & Firefox extension that displays timestamps for ChatGPT messages. The timestamps are already in the DOM - this just makes them visible.

## Installation

**Chrome Add-on: [Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kdjfhglijhebcchcfkknicfaedhhfpmo?utm_source=item-share-cb)**  
**Firefox Add-on: [Install from Mozilla Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/chatgpt-timestamp)**

## What it does

Shows when each message was sent in a clean format: "May 12 2025 - 14:30:45"

## Why I built this

I kept losing track of old conversations and couldn't remember when discussions happened. Now I can find specific chats by date/time instead of scrolling endlessly.

Also helpful for:
- Knowing when you hit rate limits and when they reset
- Tracking how long tasks take
- Finding different versions when iterating on code
